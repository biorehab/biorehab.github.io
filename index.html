<p>We are the <strong>Biological Learning and Rehabilitation Group</strong> at the department of <a href="http://www.bioe-cmcvellore.in/">Bioengineering</a>, <a href="http://www.cmch-vellore.edu/">Christian Medical College Vellore</a>.</p>
<p>We are an academic research group interested developing and validating tools and methods for the optimal training and assessment of sensorimotor function following neurological conditions. The activties in our group involves both engineering and basic science research. On the engineering side, our focus is on the development of technology-based therapeutic tools, which includes robotics, sensor-based system and electrical stimulation systems. Our work in basic science research is focused mainly on experimental and computational work in human motor control and learning.</p>
