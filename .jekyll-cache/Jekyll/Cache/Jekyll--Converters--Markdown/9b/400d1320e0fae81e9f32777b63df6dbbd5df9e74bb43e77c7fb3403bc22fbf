I"2<p>We are the Biological Learning and Rehabilitation Group at the department of Bioengineering, <a href="https://www.cmch-vellore.edu/">Christian Medical College Vellore</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/work.png" alt="" style="width: 300px; float: left; border: 10px; padding-right: 20px" /> We are an academic research group interested in developing and validating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurorehabilitation">neurorehabilitation</a> tools and methods for the optimal assessment and training of sensorimotor function following neurological conditions. We work at the interface of engineering, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromechanics">neuromechanics</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurorehabilitation">neurorehabilitation</a>.</p>

<!-- <center><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/work.png" style="width: 300px"></center> -->

<p>Our engineering work focuses developing systems for measuring and interacting with human subjects for movement assessment and training. We specialize in mechatronics (robotics and sensor-based systems), signal processing, control theory, and movement analysis. Our basic science work is neuromechanics is focuses on understanding healthy and diseased motor control/learning with strong relevance to neurorehabilitation.</p>

<p><strong>We are always looking for motivated MS or PhD students interested in our research. You can get also involved through various means: interships, proejct staff positions, etc.</strong> Please visit the <a href="">positions</a> page for more details.</p>
