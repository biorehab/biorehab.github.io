<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>
<p>Hand therapy following any neurological condition (e.g. stroke) invovles training a wide range of movements at the various hand joints. A robotic device capable of assisting movements at these different joints can be beneficial in partially automating therapy, allowing clinicains to focus on planning and supervising therapy rather than mnaually administering it. To be able to train different hand functions, we either need a set of simple robots that can train one or two specific joints, or a complex robot that can simultaneously train multiple joints. <strong>Simpler robots are likely to be more compact, affordable, and thus clinically relevant; complex robots offer no therapeutic advantage over simple robots.</strong></p>

<p>Arguably, the simplest possible robot is one with a single actuated degree-of-freedom (<em>dof</em>). Is it possible to train a wide range of hand functions (or joints) with such a robot? PLUTO was the result of us attemption to answer this question.</p>

<h4 id="system-architecture">System architecture</h4>
<p>PLUTO has a single motor to which different passive mechanisms can be attached for training different hand functions/joints. The passive mechanisms can be easily attached/detached from the robotâ€™s actuator through a simple universal coupler. The current version of PLUTO has passive mechanisms to training the following five functions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wrist flexion/extension (WFE)</li>
  <li>Wrist ulnar/radial deviation (WURD)</li>
  <li>Forearm pronation/supination (FPS)</li>
  <li>Gross hand opening and closing (HOC)</li>
  <li>Passive finger stretching (PFS). 
<br /> <br /></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="clinical-evaluation">Clinical evaluation</h4>
<p>As of August 2020, we have completed a single session usability study with 15 patient and caregivers, along with 15 clinicians at CMC Vellore.</p>

<p>We are currently preparing to conduct a longer study to evaluate the feasbility of a 2-week independent training of hand function with the device by in-patients at the Rehabilitation Institute of CMC Vellore.

#### [**SITAR**]()

**S**ystem for **I**ndependent **T**ask-oriented **A**ssessment and **R**ehabilitation is a modular, multi-modal, interactive table-top for training and assessemtn complex upper limb functional tasks. This system was originally developed by the [Human Robotics Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/human-robotics) at the [Impeiral College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

#### [**Learning Vision System**]()
The learning vision system is a computer vision based project to track the 3D kinematics of the trunk and the upper limb of human subjects during therapy and assessment using a single RGBD camera. The ultimate goal is to develop a system that can be trained through demonstration to observe and quantify movement performance for a wide range of therapy tasks.

#### [**Smoothness analysis**]()
Movement smoothness is an important movement quality related to learning and recovery. Our recent work has focused on the development and validation of a good measure for quantifying moveemnt smoothness from kinematic measurements.

#### [**Arm-use assessment**]()
Measurement of arm use in the real world is an important endpoint for any neurorehabilitation process. We havd developed a pair of wearbale IMU-based "watches" that can record linear acceleration and angular rotations which are used for detecting and quantifying functional arm-use in the the real world.

#### [**CIMT vs. RIMT**]()
Learned non-use (LNU) is believed to play an major role in relatively high functioning stroke patients not using their upper limb in their daily life. Constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) is the most popular method for countering LNU. Reinforcement induced movement therapy (RIMT) has been proposed as another potential method for reversing LNU. This work focuses on a direct comparison of these two training techniques of visuomotor adaptation and arm choice in healthy subjects.
