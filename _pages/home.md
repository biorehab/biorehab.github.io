We are the **Biological Learning and Rehabilitation (BioRehab) Group** at the department of Bioengineering, [Christian Medical College Vellore](https://www.cmch-vellore.edu/).

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/work.png){: style="width: 300px; float: left; border: 10px; padding-right: 20px"} We are an academic research group interested in developing and validating [neurorehabilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurorehabilitation) tools and methods for assessing and training sensorimotor function. We work at the interface of engineering, [neuromechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromechanics), and [neurorehabilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurorehabilitation).

Our engineering work focuses on developing systems for measuring and interacting with human movements for assessment and training. Our engineering expertise is in mechatronics (robotics and sensor-based systems), signal processing, control theory, and movement analysis. Our basic science work in neuromechanics is focused on understanding healthy and diseased motor control/learning with relevance to neurorehabilitation.

**We are always looking for motivated MS or PhD students interested in our research. You can get also involved through various other means: interships, project staff positions, etc.** Please visit the [positions](/vacancies) page for more details.
