## 2025

#### - **Nov 3, 2025: Congratulations to Dr. Monisha Yuvaraj!**

Monisha successfully defended her PhD work on “EMG-based Movement Intent Detection for Assisted Hand Neurorehabilitation in Severe Stroke.” She has published two papers (in F1000Research and IEEE Access) and presented her work on “an unsupervised approach to identify patient-specific optimal detectors for EMG-driven robot-assisted therapy” at the ICNR 6th Annual Conference, 2024 as a part of her PhD thesis. We look forward to seeing the great contributions she will continue to make in advancing technology for neurorehabilitation!

#### - **Oct 30 - 31, 2025: 15th Annual Research Day, CMC Vellore**

The 15th Annual Research Day was held on October 30–31 at the Bagayam Campus, Vellore, where five students from our group presented posters in the Research Scholars and MS students categories. Our PhD scholar Neelakshi Ganguly and Project Research Engineers Sriramachandran and Lishwanth RK won second place for their poster in the Research Scholar category. Congratulations on this wonderful achievement and wishing you many more successes ahead! :)

#### - **June 30 - July 5, 2025: AI Rehackathon, 2025**

The Department of Bioengineering and the Biomedical Informatics Unit at Christian Medical College Vellore hosted a week-long online hackathon with 16 registered teams. Participants worked on developing and validating machine learning models to predict upper-limb use with the highest accuracy, an exciting challenge towards advancing AI-driven rehabilitation. A team from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and another from IIT Madras shared the first prize. We thank all participants for their participation and look forward to many more such “happy hacking” events ahead.

## 2021

#### - **Dec 23, 21: Thira Rehab Solutions receives TANSEED award from the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister.**
Thira Rehab Solutions - a start up from the BioRehab group and the R2D2 lab from IIT Madras recieved the TANSEED award from the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu - Mr. M K Stalin. The award was seed funding of INR 10 Lakhs to help develop PLUTO into a commercial prototype. <a href="https://youtu.be/IfElkf0WjlA?t=42">Aravind received the check</a> for INR 5 Lakhs at the secretariat and gave a short interview to Kalaignar TV.

#### - **Sep 24, 21: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9548086?source=authoralert">Plug-and-Train Robot (PLUTO) for Hand Rehabilitation: Design and Preliminary Evaluation</a>.**
What is the simplest possible robot for hand neurorehabilitation? What can such a robot do for training and assessing hand functions? Aravind's doctoral research focuses on the development and clinical validation of a modular, single DOF robot for hand neurorehabilitation - PLUTO. In this paper, we present the design and preliminary validation of the first version of PLUTO, which was tested on patients, clinicians, and caregivers at CMC Vellore. 

#### - **Jun 22, 21: Follow-up on Ann's work <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.667509/full">A framework for upper-limb functioning assessment</a>.**
While exploring different methods for quantifying upper-limb use as part of Ann's PhD work, we realized the need for a proper framework for assessing upper-limb functioning in hemiparetic patients. Various groups have been publishing methods for visualizing and quantifying upper-limb functioning using wearable sensors. But often we found that the definitions of different terms were unclear. This work proposes a framework starting with clear definitions of different constructs of interest. We also present systematic analysis of different ways of visualzing data collected from sensors, along with a couple of metrics for quantifying upper-limb activity and relative upper-limb use. The data collected from Ann's previous study was used to demonstrate some of the ideas presented in the paper.  

#### - **Jun 7, 21: The group's first PhD Ann's first paper :) <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20556683211019694">Quantification of the relative arm use</a>.**
A part of Ann's PhD work was recently published in <a href="https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/journal/journal-rehabilitation-and-assistive-technologies-engineering">JRATE</a>. This work focuses on the use of a inertial measurement units for measuring the relative use of the two upper-limbs in patients with hemiparesis. We made use of the gross movement (GM) score developed by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11517-016-1496-7">Luenberger et al.<a/>. We observed that the GM score has only fair accuracy in detecting upper-limb use. We also presented methods for visualizing relative upper-limb use, and a method for quantifying asymmetry in use. 

#### - **Jun 28 - Jul 16, 21: Organized <a href="http://neurorehack.com">NeuroRehack</a>.**

We organized the first edition of <a href="http://neurorehack.com">NeuroRehack</a> -- an international Summer/Winter school and Hackathon in Neurorehabilitation Engineering. We had great response from students from across the world in spite of very little advertisement of the event. We had a great line-up of fantastic speakers from the field who helped introduce the undergrdatue and graduate students to the field's fundamentals and state-of-the-art. 

A team from the University of Queensland and one from Christian Medical College Vellore were joint winners of the hackathon.

#### - **May 20, 21: Monisha gets the  Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship.**
Monisha Yuvaraj, a PhD student in the group has received the Prime Minister's Research Fellowship for her proposed PhD thesis on EMG-triggered robot assisted therapy. She will be exploring appropriate methods for EMG triggered robot assisted therapy and evaluating its efficacy in severely affected stroke patients as part of doctoral research.

#### - **Jan 21, 21: How can we estimate smoothness using IMUs? Take a look at our paper <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2020.558771/full">Estimating smoothness using IMUs</a>.**

Extending our previous work on movement smoothness, we investigated whether existing methods such as spectral arclength (SPARC) and Log dimensionless jerk (LDLJ) can be used with data from an IMU. After 5 years of exploring different approaches, we propose a modified version of the LDLJ measure to work directly with accelerometer data. This work demonstrates that movements of the reference frame will confound movement smoothness.

## 2020
#### **Dec 12, 20: “Artificial Intelligence for advancing healthcare across India and Sweden” proposal approved! :)**

Our collaborative project with <a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/persons/christian-antfolk(b8da39ee-4f0d-46c8-80da-0879b1f27e62).html">Dr. Christian Antfolk</a>'s group at <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/">Lund University</a> has been approved. This project will extend out work on upper-limb functioning assessment using wearable sensors by bringing cutting-edge AI/ML algorithms for improved accuracy of detection of upper-limb use and tasks during daily living. The next three years are going to be exciting!!!!
