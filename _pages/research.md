# Research

Our ultimate goal is to have a positive impact on routine clinical practice in sensorimotor neurorehabilitation by: 
* Simplify and translate neurorehabilitation technology.
* Advance foundations of quantitative sensorimotor assessment.
* Pushing the boundaries of neurorehabilitation through healthy/diseased neuromechanics.
